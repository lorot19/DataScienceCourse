# DataScienceCourse
Project dedicated for DataScience course. 

## Project 1
For someone listening too much music could be one of bad habit but what if I told you that I can guess if you are drinker, smoker or if you are cheating in school just by your music preferencies? I belive that now you checked your Spotify account what do you have in public playlists but dont worry and lets see what we really know about you.

This part is related to the first project within Data Science course.
Purpose of first project was practice work with dataset in Jupyter notebook. In first project following techniques are used:
* NaN drop
* Data imputation with mean
* Creating subset
* Corelation analysis

## Dataset
Our dataset “Young People Surve” is from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey and contains answers to questionnaire were collected by students of Statistics class at FSEV UK in Slovakia were they was asked to invite their friends to participate in this survey.
Dataset contains at least 150 unique columns with questions focusen on demographic, music and movies preferencies, bad habbits and other personality related questions asked 1010 individuals.
We selected only part of the dataset and focused on relationship between bad habits like drinking, cheating or smoking and music preferencies. Let's see what we found.

There are multiple findings about corelation between bad habits like Smoking or Drinking Alcohol and music preferencies.
